        "1. What is a parameter?\n",
        " - A parameter is a measurable characteristic or fixed value that helps define or describe a system, situation, or population. In mathematics and statistics, a parameter usually refers to a numerical value that describes an entire group, such as the average (mean) height of all students in a school. Unlike a variable, which can change, a parameter is generally considered constant within a specific context. In programming, a parameter is a value that is passed into a function so that the function can use it to perform a specific task. Overall, a parameter sets the limits or conditions under which something operates or is analyzed.\n",

        "\n",
        "Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following fixed instructions, a machine learning system identifies patterns in data and makes predictions or decisions based on those patterns.\n",

        "Yes/No responses\n",
        "\n",
        "6. How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n",
        " - In Machine Learning, categorical variables cannot be used directly because most algorithms work only with numerical data, so they must be converted into numbers before training the model. This process is called encoding. One common technique is Label Encoding, where each category is assigned a unique number. Another widely used method is One-Hot Encoding, which creates separate binary (0 or 1) columns for each category to avoid introducing any false order between them. When categories have a natural ranking, Ordinal Encoding is used to assign ordered numerical values. For datasets with many categories, techniques like Binary Encoding help reduce the number of columns created. In advanced cases, Target (Mean) Encoding replaces each category with the average value of the target variable for that category. Overall, the choice of technique depends on whether the categories have order and how many unique categories are present in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        " 7. What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n",
        "  - Training and testing a dataset are two important steps in Machine Learning used to build and evaluate a model.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we train a model, we give it a portion of the dataset called the training dataset. The model learns patterns, relationships, and rules from this data. It adjusts its internal parameters to minimize errors and improve accuracy. In simple words, training is the learning phase of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "After training, we use another portion of the data called the testing dataset to check how well the model performs on new, unseen data. The testing data is not shown to the model during training. This step helps us evaluate the model’s accuracy and determine whether it has learned properly or is just memorizing the training data (overfitting).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n",
        " - sklearn.preprocessing is a module in the Python library scikit-learn that is used for data preprocessing before applying machine learning algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "Preprocessing means preparing raw data so that it can be properly used by machine learning models. Most models work better when the data is clean, scaled, and converted into numerical form.\n",
        "The sklearn.preprocessing module provides tools for tasks such as:\n",
        "Scaling features (e.g., StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler)\n",
        "Normalizing data\n",
        "Encoding categorical variables (e.g., LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder)\n",
        "Binarizing data\n",
        "For example, if one feature has values between 0–1 and another has values between 0–10,000, scaling helps bring them to a similar range so that the model performs better.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a Test set?\n",
        " - A test set is a portion of a dataset that is used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model after it has been trained. It contains data that the model has never seen before during training. The purpose of the test set is to check how well the model can make predictions on new, unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "By testing the model on this separate dataset, we can measure its accuracy, error rate, or other performance metrics. This helps determine whether the model has truly learned patterns from the data or if it has simply memorized the training data (a problem called overfitting).\n",

        "10. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n",
        "How do you approach a Machine Learning problem?\n",
        " - 1. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, we commonly split data using the train_test_split() function from the scikit-learn library.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, the dataset is divided into:\n",
        "\n",
        "Training set → Used to train (fit) the model\n",
        "\n",
        "Testing set → Used to evaluate the model\n",
        "\n",
        "Example steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "Import train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection\n",
        "\n",
        "Choose the test size (for example, 20% or 30%)\n",
        "\n",
        "Split the features (X) and target (y)\n",
        "\n",
        "Typically:\n",
        "\n",
        "70–80% data → Training\n",
        "\n",
        "20–30% data → Testing\n",
        "\n",
        "This ensures the model learns from one portion of data and is evaluated on unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. How do you approach a Machine Learning problem?\n",
        "\n",
        "A systematic approach is very important. The general steps are:\n",
        "1️⃣ Understand the Problem\n",
        "Clearly define the objective (classification, regression, etc.).\n",
        "2️⃣ Collect and Understand Data\n",
        "Explore the dataset and understand features and target variables.\n",
        "3️⃣ Data Preprocessing\n",
        "Handle missing values\n",
        "Encode categorical variables\n",
        "Scale/normalize features\n",
        "4️⃣ Split the Data\n",
        "Divide into training and testing sets.\n",
        "5️⃣ Choose a Model\n",

        "Use the model in real-world applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?\n",
        " - xploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed before fitting a model to understand the data properly and prepare it for accurate modeling. It helps us examine the structure, patterns, and quality of the dataset before applying any machine learning algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "EDA is important because it allows us to identify missing values, outliers, incorrect data types, and errors in the dataset. If these issues are not handled, the model may give poor or misleading results. It also helps us understand the relationship between variables, detect correlations, and decide which features are important for prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "By visualizing and summarizing the data, we can choose the right preprocessing techniques (such as encoding or scaling) and select an appropriate model. Without EDA, we may apply the wrong algorithm or misinterpret the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is correlation?\n",
        " - Correlation is a statistical measure that shows the relationship between two variables, specifically how they move in relation to each other.\n",
        "If a change in one variable is associated with a change in another variable, the two variables are said to be correlated.\n",
        "There are three main types of correlation:\n",
        "Positive correlation: Both variables move in the same direction.\n",
        "(If one increases, the other also increases.)\n",
        "Negative correlation: Variables move in opposite directions.\n",
        "(If one increases, the other decreases.)\n",
        "Zero correlation: No relationship exists between the variables.\n",
        "Correlation is usually measured by a number called the correlation coefficient, which ranges from –1 to +1:\n",
        "+1 → Perfect positive correlation\n",
        "–1 → Perfect negative correlation\n",
        "0 → No correlation\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        " - Negative correlation means that two variables move in opposite directions.\n",
        "When one variable increases, the other decreases, and when one decreases, the other increases, the variables are said to have a negative correlation.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "As price increases, demand decreases.\n",
        "As speed increases, time taken to travel a fixed distance decreases.\n",
        "In statistics, negative correlation is represented by a correlation coefficient between 0 and –1.\n",
        "–1 indicates a perfect negative correlation.\n",
        "Values closer to –1 show a strong negative relationship.\n",
        "Values closer to 0 show a weak negative relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How can you find correlation between variables in Python?\n",
        " - You can find the correlation between variables in Python mainly using the pandas and NumPy libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most common method is using the .corr() function in pandas. If your data is stored in a DataFrame, you can calculate the correlation between all numerical columns by simply writing:\n",

        "import pandas as pd\n",
        "\n",
        "df = pd.read_csv(\"data.csv\")\n",
        "correlation_matrix = df.corr()\n",
        "print(correlation_matrix)\n",
        "\n",
        "This will give you a correlation matrix, which shows the correlation coefficient between every pair of numerical variables. By default, it calculates Pearson correlation.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you want correlation between two specific variables, you can write:\n",
        "\n",
        "df[\"column1\"].corr(df[\"column2\"])\n",
        "\n",
        "Using NumPy, you can calculate correlation like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "import numpy as np\n",
        "\n",
        "np.corrcoef(x, y)\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is causation? Explain difference between correlation and causation with an example.\n",
        " - Causation refers to a relationship where one variable directly causes a change in another variable. It means there is a clear cause-and-effect connection between the two.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main difference between correlation and causation is that correlation only shows that two variables are related or move together, while causation shows that one variable actually produces an effect on the other. In correlation, variables may change together, but there is no proof that one is responsible for the change. In causation, the change in one variable is the direct reason for the change in the other.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, during summer, ice cream sales and drowning cases both increase. These two are positively correlated because they rise at the same time. However, ice cream does not cause drowning. The real cause is hot weather, which increases both ice cream consumption and swimming activities. This is correlation, not causation.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, if a person increases their study time and their exam marks improve, the extra study time directly contributes to better performance. This is an example of causation.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is an Optimizer? What are different types of optimizers? Explain each with an example\n",
        " - What is an Optimizer?\n",
        "\n",
        "An optimizer is an algorithm used in Machine Learning and Deep Learning to minimize the loss function by updating the model’s parameters (weights and biases). Its main goal is to find the best values of parameters so that the model makes accurate predictions.\n",
        "During training, the optimizer adjusts the weights step-by-step to reduce error and improve performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Types of Optimizers\n",
        "1️⃣ Gradient Descent\n",

        "Example:\n",
        "If the loss is high, gradient descent adjusts the weights slightly to reduce the error step-by-step.\n",

        "If we have 1000 data points, SGD updates weights after each single data point instead of waiting for all 1000.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Faster updates\n",
        "⚠ More fluctuations in learning\n",
        "\n",
        "3️⃣ Momentum\n",
        "Momentum improves SGD by adding a fraction of the previous update to the current update. It helps move faster in the correct direction and reduces oscillations.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Like pushing a ball down a hill — it gains speed in the correct direction.\n",
        "\n",
        "4️⃣ AdaGrad (Adaptive Gradient)\n",
        "AdaGrad adjusts the learning rate for each parameter automatically. Parameters with frequent updates get smaller learning rates.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Useful in text classification where some words appear more often than others.\n",
        "\n",
        "5️⃣ RMSProp\n",
        "RMSProp improves AdaGrad by preventing the learning rate from becoming too small. It works well for deep neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "6️⃣ Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)\n",
        "Adam combines the advantages of Momentum and RMSProp. It is one of the most widely used optimizers.\n",
